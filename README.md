LinkedIn

LinkedIn is basically the “Instagram for jobs,” except instead of pictures people show off promotions and certificates.

Things I like:
Clean professional profiles
“Easy Apply” button
Good messaging system
Job recommendations
Huge network of companies

Things I don’t want to copy:
Too many useless inspirational posts
Some features are locked behind premium
What I’ll take: profiles, quick apply, messaging.

Indeed
Indeed is the biggest job search engine. When people look for a job, they usually start here.

Good stuff:
Tons of job listings
Super strong search filters
Simple layout
Resume builder
Company reviews and salary info

Bad stuff:
A lot of repeated or outdated listings
What I’ll take: simple UI + strong search filters.

Glassdoor
Glassdoor is where people go to see if a company sucks before applying.

Good:
Company reviews
Salary transparency
Interview experience reports

Bad:
Some reviews feel fake
What I’ll take: reviews + salary info.

Monster
Monster is an older platform. Still useful but feels outdated.

Good points:
Many listings
Easy application process

Annoying parts:
Old-school design
Many duplicate listings
This reminded me to keep my UI modern and avoid duplicates.

ZipRecruiter

ZipRecruiter is very fast, especially on mobile.
Strengths:
Great mobile design
AI-driven job recommendations
Super-fast apply process
What I’ll take: mobile-friendly design + recommendations.

Craigslist / Local Boards

Craigslist is useful for gigs but full of spam.
Lesson learned:
My platform must avoid anonymous & fake job posts.

Features I Want to Include

After comparing everything, these are the features I’m definitely putting in my project:
Advanced job filters (salary, type, remote, etc.)
User accounts for job seekers + employers
Profiles / résumé upload
Job posting system
Easy Apply feature
Company pages with reviews
Messaging/contact system
Job alerts/notifications
Mobile-friendly design
Proper security + anti-spam measures
These are the features almost everyone agrees make a job platform actually useful.


What I Want to Avoid

Based on what annoys people on existing platforms:
Fake or scam job listings
Outdated job posts
Too many ads or paywalls
Overcomplicated registration
Slow, buggy interfaces
“Apply” pages that redirect 15 times


My goal is for the site to feel simple, clean, fast, and trustworthy.
Since it’s a job portal, I’m building it for everyone who needs work — students, adults, part-timers, remote workers, literally anyone. And employers of all sizes should be able to post jobs easily.
So instead of targeting one group, I’m focusing on making the site as universal and easy to understand as possible.

High-Level Tech Direction
I’m building this with the tools I’m learning in school:
C#
ASP.NET
MVC
Entity Framework
SQL Server

This section will become more detailed later when I actually start implementing it.


Here’s what I learned:

The best job platforms are easy to search, easy to navigate, and easy to apply on.
They show clear job info, salaries, and company reviews.
They keep the design simple and support fast applications.
The worst platforms are full of spam, outdated posts, and confusing layouts.
People hate slow, complicated, or scammy-feeling job sites.
